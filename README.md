Highly interpretable, sklearn-compatible classifier based on decision rules
===============

This is a scikit-learn compatible wrapper for the Bayesian Rule List classifier developed by [Benjamin Letham et al., 2014](http://) - all credit belongs to him ([original code](http://)).

It produces rule lists, which makes trained classifiers **easily interpretable to human experts**, and is competitive with state of the art classifiers such as random forests or SVMs.
